# Final Milestone
My final milestone is getting the sensor to work.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is to get the app to control the arm via bluetooth. This was done using an ESP-32 chip, which is like an Arduino with bluetooth capabilities. Using the MIT App Inventor, I made an app with 4 sliders to control the 4 servos, and the ability to connect to the ESP-32 with bluetooth. I no longer need the computer program to control the arm, although I can still use it along with the app.

# First Milestone

My first milestone is to finish building the arm, and to get the motors to control it. There are 4 servos, which are powered by an Arduino and a 6V battery pack. The servos control rotation of the base, opening and closing of the claw, and motion of the arm (forward/backward/left/right). They are controlled by an Arduino computer program where you can enter degree numbers and that will rotate each servo individually to any degree (between 0 and 180).
